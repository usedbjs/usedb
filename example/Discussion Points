Discussion Points

1. Validation layer on input on creation (Can be handled on model level in laravel)
2. Restriction on where clause. 
3. Figure out restricting some fields. e.g. password in db.User.find()
4. Relational queries depth control
5. Resolvers for non db fields? e.g. isLiked in a Post. Cases where Queries != DB models
6. Rate limiting
7. Authentication
