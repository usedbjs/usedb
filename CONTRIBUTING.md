### Docs

Improvements to the documentation are always welcome. You can find them in the on [`usedbjs.github.io`](https://github.com/usedbjs/usedb-docs) repository. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build our documentation website. The website is published automatically whenever the `master` branch is updated.

### Examples

useDB comes with a Todo App example to demonstrate various concepts and best practices.

When adding a new example, please adhere to the style and format of the existing examples, and try to reuse as much code as possible.

#### Testing the Examples

To test the official React Pluggabel examples, run the following:

Install dependencies using yarn

```sh
yarn
```

Then run the example using

```sh
yarn start
```

Not all examples have tests. If you see an example project without tests, you are very welcome to add them in a way consistent with the examples that have tests.

<!-- Please visit the [Examples page](http://localhost:3000/usedb/docs/todo-example) for information on running individual examples. -->
